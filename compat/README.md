# Compatibility Patches

This directory contains patches that address incompatibilities between my mods
and other mods. You should not install them unless you are using the relevant
mods, and if using them, should load them late, after both relevant mods.

**Mandatory** patches are ones that prevent things from breaking. **Optional**
patches may add polish but the game will still be playable normally without
them.

## For Gun Bonsai

- `GunBonsai×HighNoonDrifter`: fixes the HND bow when used with GB. **Mandatory**.
- `GunBonsai×AngelicAviary-AngelicShards`: replaces the builtin actors for Scavenge Blood and Scavenge Steel with AA's actors. **Optional**.
- `GunBonsai×WarTrophies-NoDOTKills`: does not record kills made with GB damage-over-time effects in WT. **Optional**.

## For gzArchipelago

- `Archipelago×FinalDoomer`: Fixes check spawning and weapon suppression behaviour when Final Doomer is loaded. **Mandatory** unless you play FD with "generic visuals" enabled.
- `Archipelago×DoomRL Arsenal`: Fixes powerup spawners from being collected before being able to spawn powerups and crates. **Mandatory**.
