# ifdef <classes> { ... }
# Executes the given block only if at least one of the listed classes is defined.

# Add the listed upgrades to the registry, making them available for play.
# It's safe to add the same upgrade more than once.
#
# unregister <upgrades> ;
# Remove the listed upgrades from the registry. Use this to disable upgrades that
# aren't compatible with some mods.
#
# merge <classes> ;
# Consider all of the listed classes to the same weapon type. This is primarily
# useful when one weapon is used as a replacement or upgrade for another one.
#
# disable <classes> : <upgrades> ;
# Disable the listed upgrades on the given weapon classes only.
#
# type <classes> : <type> ;
# Declare the listed weapons to be of the given type, overriding autodetection.
# Type is one of: MELEE HITSCAN PROJECTILE IGNORE AUTO
# IGNORE will force Bonsai to ignore that weapon entirely and not assign XP to it.
# AUTO will force it to autodetect; this is the default, but can be specified
# explicitly to override a prior non-AUTO type directive.
#
# A <classes> list is just one or more class names separated by whitespace. It
# can also be a class prefix by appending *, e.g. Endi* will match all weapon
# classes starting with "Endie". Class names are not case sensitive.
#
# An <upgrades> list is the same but for upgrade names. Wildcards are not
# supported; exact class names must be used.

# All builtin upgrades that don't require other mods to function are registered
# here. Mod-specific stanzas below tweak things further.
