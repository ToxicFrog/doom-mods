// skill=1 and end up dropping you into HMP, which is both harder than you
// signed up for and has the wrong spawns...

//// Scanner configuration.
// These are not written to the save file or config file, since they're more

// For most wads, you can just do something like:
// ] ap_scan_levels "MAP01"
// ] netevent ap-scan:start
// and it'll scan the entire wad. If it's broken into episodes, like Doom 1, you
// might instead need something like:
// ] ap_scan_levels "E1M1 E2M1 E3M1 E4M1"
// ] netevent ap-scan:start
// If this is one of those wads where, e.g., there are five levels but they
// continue on into the Doom 2 levels after the last one, you probably want to
// turn off recursion:
// ] ap_scan_recurse false
// ] ap_scan_levels "MAP01 MAP02 MAP03 MAP04 MAP05"
// ] netevent ap-scan:start

// levels reachable from them will be scanned. Otherwise, only these levels
// exactly will be. Space-separated.

// - level transitions using zscript or intermap teleport specials are not
//   currently detected, only NextMap/NextSecretMap MAPINFO entries
// - levels listed in NextSecretMap are considered reachable even if there is
//   no secret exit in the level itself
nosave noarchive bool ap_scan_recurse = true;
// Mark one or more checks unreachable.
// If set to 1, the next check you collect will be flagged.
// If set to 2, all checks you collect until the level exit will be flagged,
// and additionally, exiting the level will collect all remaining checks in it.
