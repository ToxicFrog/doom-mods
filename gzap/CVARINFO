//// Scanner configuration.
// These are not written to the save file or config file, since they're more

//
// For wads without defaults, you can usually do something like this:
//    ] ap_scan_levels "MAP01"
//    ] netevent ap-scan:start
// and it'll scan the entire wad. If it's broken into episodes, like Doom 1, you
// might instead need something like:
//    ] ap_scan_levels "E1M1 E2M1 E3M1 E4M1"
//    ] netevent ap-scan:start
// If this is one of those wads where, e.g., there are five levels but they
// continue on into the Doom 2 levels after the last one, you probably want to
// turn off recursion:
//    ] ap_scan_recurse false
//    ] ap_scan_levels "MAP01 MAP02 MAP03 MAP04 MAP05"
//    ] netevent ap-scan:start

// List of levels to scan. If ap_scan_recurse is set, these levels and all
// levels reachable from them will be scanned. Otherwise, only these levels
// exactly will be. Space-separated.

// level reachable by exits from those levels will be as well, recursively.

// - level transitions using zscript or ACS are not detected, nor are normal
//   exits or levelports that start inactive and are activated later via scripts
// - levels listed in NextSecretMap are considered reachable even if there is
//   no secret exit in the level itself
