If you've never used GZDoom before, you will need to download two things:
- GZDoom itself
- a launcher in order to organize the selected game and the AP mods (as well as any other optional mods not specified in this guide)

GZDoom is available on Github, and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/releases). 

There are several launchers available, and for the purposes of this guide, will direct you to ZDL, which has several community options located [here](https://zdoom.org/wiki/ZDL).

This guide will reference the AceCorp Launcher from the ZDL page above.

1. Download GZDoom from the above link and extract it into a folder somewhere on your computer.
2. Download the AceCorp Launcher and put it in the same directory where you extracted GZDoom, so that it is in the same folder with gzdoom.exe.
3. Download whichever Doom IWAD or PWAD you want to play and place it in the same directory with gzdoom.exe.
4. Download the GZDoom AP mod and place it in the same directory with gzdoom.exe.

Now that we have prepared the files for playing, we will need to set up the game and mods in order play.

1. Open AceCorp Launcher.
2. In the IWAD dropdown, click the +/- button and select your downloaded WAD file.
3. In the Engine dropdown, click the +/- button and select gzdoom.exe.
4. In the large box under the dropdowns, right click and select Add File, and select your downloaded WAD file.
5. In the same box under the dropdowns, right click and select Add File, and select the gzArchipelago pk3 file.

You should now have your game on top of the gzArchipelago mod in the large window.

Click Launch to start the game.

Once in game, open the Options Menu > Full options menu > verify that gzArchipelago Options appears at the bottom.
