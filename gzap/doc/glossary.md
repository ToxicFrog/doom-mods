# Glossary of Terms

It can get confusing wrangling stuff that is modeled in both the game and in the
randomizer but in different ways and for different purposes, so this file holds
the terminology I've settled on and try to keep the code in line with.

## Check

An *in-world* object associated with a *Location*. This is what the player actually
sees and touches in-game. It is mostly just a visible, collectable token, with the
actual randomizer state stored *out-of-world*.

## Globbing Expression

A way of concisely writing a match for multiple maps (or items, filenames, etc...)
at once. In a glob, `*` matches anything, and `?` matches any one character. So:
- `E1M*` matches all maps in episode 1
- `E?M1` matches the first map of episodes 1-9 (but not E10M1, etc)
- `MAP?2` matches MAP02, MAP12, MAP22, etc
- `*` matches anything at all

These are supported by some of the YAML options to save you having to type out
dozens of individual maps.

## GZAP

Short for gzArchipelago, i.e. Archipelago for gzDoom. `GZAP_` is used as the
prefix for all gzArchipelago classes to avoid collisions with other mods.

## In-World

Objects that exist in the level somewhere, such as the player and *Check* actors.

## Item Category

An internal category assigned by the scanner and used by the randomizer to make
decisions about which items are replaced with checks and which ones are progression,
useful, or filler. Some categories can be turned on and off in the YAML.

Both items and locations have categories; a location's category is based on the
item originally found there, or the nature of the location if it never had an item.

A logic file can use any categories it wants and the apworld will automatically
pick it up, but the current list of categories used by the scanner is:

- `key`: keycards, skulls, etc; specific to a single level
- `weapon`: any sort of weapon
- `map`: automaps
- `powerup`: time-limited powerups (e.g. radsuits)
- `secret-sector`: a secret (distinct from any items *in* that secret)
- Health and armor items:
  - `big-health`/`big-armor`: at least 100 points
  - `medium-health`/`medium-armor`: at least 25 points but less than 100
  - `small-health`/`small-armor`: less than 25 points
- Ammunition:
  - `big-ammo`: backpacks and backpack-alikes
  - `medium-ammo`: rocket boxes, cell packs, etc
  - `small-ammo`: individual rockets, energy cells, etc
- `tool`: inventory items that aren't in any other category (e.g. time bombs)
- `token`: used internally by the apworld for things like access codes and level exits

The `Megasphere`, which restores both health and armour, is considered `big-armor`.

Unrecognized ammo (e.g. from total conversions) is considered `medium` if it
refills at least 20% of your carrying capacity, and `small` otherwise.

There are no items tagged `secret-sector`, but turning it on in the YAML will
cause secrets (in addition to the items inside them, where applicable) to be
treated as checks.

## Level Rank

A measure of how far into the game a given level is. Any level you can reach from
the New Game screen is rank 0; levels you can reach from those are rank 1, etc.
The randomizer uses this for difficulty-based logic adjustments, based on the
theory that levels later in the game are probably harder than earlier levels.

For episode-based games like Doom 1 or Heretic, *every* start-of-episode level
is rank 0, so (e.g.) E1M1, E2M1, and E3M1 are all rank 0 and are all considered
"before" E1M2.

Since rank is based on what order you can reach the levels in when playing,
rather than what order they're listed in the WAD, the Doom 2 secret levels
MAP31 and MAP32 have ranks 15 and 16, in keeping with their position roughly
halfway through the game.

## Location

The *out-of-world* data about a location where a randomized item can be placed.
Contains information about how to display it, how to locate the actor to replace
in the world, and how to report its collection to Archipelago.

## Location Category

See *Item Category*.

## Out-Of-World

Objects that are part of the playsim but do not exist in the world. The
`EventHandler`s used to manage the rando state, for example.

## Position

The position of an object in the Doom world space, as an (X,Y,Z) coordinate triple.
Also contains information about what map it comes from.

Some *Locations* are marked "virtual", meaning they exist for the purposes of the
randomizer but don't have a fixed position in the world, and are "visited" by
other means (such as finishing a level).

## Tuning

A process of automatically improving the randomizer logic for a given WAD by
analyzing playthrough records. When you first import a WAD the logic is fairly
rough because it can't tell what keys you need to reach which items; by observing
actual play, it can improve the logic and produce more varied randomizations.

## Region

A collection of related *Locations*. In GZAP there is a one-to-one mapping between
Regions and maps. Internally, a Region contains all of the Locations within it,
along with map-wide flags: whether it's accessible, whether it's completed, and
what map-specific items (keys, automap) the player has for it.

## zspp

A simple zscript preprocessor that handles namespacing and some transformation of
debug directives. `.zs` files in the repo are inputs; `.zsc` files are what
actually gets loaded by gzDoom.
