# TODO: add/implement options for:
# - in-level/across-level monster shuffle
# - in-level/across-level minor item shuffle
# - behaviour on death
# - weapon logic
# - win logic: all levels/N levels/all bosses/N bosses
# - are bosses checks
# - are exits checks (in addition to giving you a clear token)
#   we do this by registering multiple checks per level, adding a new API to the
#   generated zscript to register them all, and checking all of them on exit
# - progressive automap -- automaps bind to the first unmapped level you have,
#   and/or you need multiple automaps to display everything for a level (say,
#   one gets you checks, one gets you geometry, one gets you progression hilights)
# - progressive keys -- this will be tricky to implement, I think, but the idea
#   is that keys start out unformed, and the first door you use when having an
#   unformed key specializes it for that door. Alternately, have a menu that
#   lets you intentionally form keys. Adds more choice about what you unlock when.
#   From talking to people on the discord, this (a) has no particular support in
#   AP, you need to implement it yourself and (b) is very hard to get right in
#   ways that are both fun and reliably avoid softlocks. Probably going to avoid
#   this for now.
