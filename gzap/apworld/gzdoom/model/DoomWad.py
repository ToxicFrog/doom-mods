"""
Data model for a (mega)WAD.

At generation time, generation operates on a single wad. So the wad model needs
to keep track of:
- what levels are in the wad
- what locations are in those levels (and must thus be added to the pool)
- what items were originally in those locations (likewise)
- what difficulty level to play on
- what map to start on
