# THE KEY LIFECYCLE
#
# When a key is detected by the scanner, it emits an AP-KEY message, containing
# information about the key's typename, what level it was found in, and what
# levels it applies to (e.g. in a Hexen-style hubcluster, a key found in one
# level typically applies to all levels in that cluster).
#
# Upon encountering an AP-KEY message, the apworld creates one of these DoomKey
# records for it, and adds it to the DoomWad indexed by FQIN (which is based on
# the key's typename and level set).
#
# When tuning a location, the unqualified key names in the tuning record are
# matched up with the corresponding key records for that map, and recorded in
# the tuned keysets for that location; the FQINs are then checked against the
# player inventory in the access rule during generation.
#
# At the end of logic+tuning processing, every location that we do not have
# a tuning record for is initialized with a fully pessimal keyset: the set of
# all keys known to apply to that map.
