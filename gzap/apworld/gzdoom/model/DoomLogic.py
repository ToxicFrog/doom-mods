"""
Top-level class for holding the actual game logic.

In order for datapack generation in multiworld games to work right, we need to
incorporate the information for *all wads that we know about*. So this class
holds per-wad information association locations with maps and grouping the maps
together into wads, as well as cross-wad information about all the items and
locations we are aware of across all supported wads, used for populating the
datapack.

(We can't selectively load this based on randomizer configuration because, at
present, the datapack is generated as soon as the apworld is loaded, before the
World subclass is even instantiated; well before we have access to the yaml.)
