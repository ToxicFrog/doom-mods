    to function, and which is also user-facing -- is currently drawn from the name of
    the enclosing map, plus the name of the item that originally occupied that location.

    If multiple locations in a map had the same item -- which is not uncommon, especially
    in larger levels -- all the locations with name collisions are disambiguated
    using their X,Y coordinates.
