# Roadmap

## gzArchipelago

To release a new version:
- update the version number in the CHANGELOG and Makefile
- make
- commit
- tag and push the commit
- make again to bake the release version number into the pk3
- cut the release on github

### next release

(0.7 is focusing on logic/tuning format changes and bugfixes)

(maybe wait for 0.7.1)
- weapon suppression just makes the gun non-interactable rather than tuning it into ammo?
- weapon ownership rework
- display weapons in inventory even if you don't have them
- let you hint weapons from the inventory screen
- hints section in the inventory screen for hints pointing to the current level
- associate a region with each map and allow configuring it with AP-REGION
  - map access requires access key + other region requirements
  - DoomRegion implicitly wants an enclosing map so we probably want to inherit from DoomReachable in DoomMap
- logic engine changes to acommodate hubclusters
  - keep track of which locations are in which regions
    - rework create_regions to use this info
    - use it for weapon logic

### scanner

- list maps to scan as ranges or globbing expressions?

### generator

- option to treat bosses as checks -- also needs scanner changes, highly vulnerable
  to enemy-replacement mods
  - could try placing the check in the boss's inventory, and on the ground where
    the boss would be if we can't find it
- alternate win conditions:
  - find N victory tokens
  - find N secrets
- option to choose the X% of an item category game-wide rather than per-map
- item tag support, allowing to treat "small", "health", and "secret" (e.g.) as
  separate tags -- need to figure out how the YAML works for this

### ingame

- If a check gets destroyed (e.g. with thing_remove), we should dispense whatever
  it contained. This would let us (e.g.) reinstate the urns and shields in Faithless
  E1M7 without the risk of making the game unwinnable.

- TT has a bunch of stuff that breaks it: single-use teleport lines, scripts that
  take away your guns and keys on level start
  - we can probably be better about keeping the player's key inventory up to
    date, at least.
  - can we do anything about weapons? remember how many the player has been
    vended and re-vend them if they run out?

- "gzap for apdoom users" man page
- some hints received when playing in the weekly sync did not display on the
  map screen
- Ashes 2063 reports duplicate keys because of the way keys are handled -- you
  pick up the BluePassCard and it gives you a BlueCard in your inventory, which
  the AP runtime then identifies as a new key scoped to that level, which can be
  a bit confusing but generally does not affect normal play.

### Faithless

### Adventures of Square

Some areas require Hellshell to reach via rocket jumping -- all in E2M3 so far,
but there are probably more. Need to make sure they are catalogued correctly.

Powerzade is often load-bearing for progression, similar to envirosuits or fishbowls.
It should be either excluded from randomization or handled differently. The way
it's scripted, there's a thing that respawns it if the original is gone, but since
we just *hide* the check when collected, we don't *delete* it, the respawn doesn't work.

HotSauce is also used in E1M10 to unlock a secret.

### Golden Souls

Basic structure is one central hub map from which all other maps branch off. Access
to these maps is gated based on number of Golden Souls or Big Coins found, with
only map accessible initially.

Each map contains weapons, ammo, health, small coins, enemies (which drop small coins),
and one or more Golden Souls and Big Coins. Some levels contain red coins and all
red coins must be collected to reveal the GS.

For this we probably want to abandon access tokens entirely, or model them as-well-as
golden souls. This means we also need a way to say "the requirements for entering
map X are Y". It already has full persistence and a hub, so we don't need the
generated MAPINFO or even, probably, the level select screen.

Internally, we have a bunch of inventory items:
Star_Soul - golden soul
Big_Coin_Total, Big_Coin - incremented when you find a BC
BigCoinsInMap - you get one of these when in a map that has BCs
Token_BigCoinCounter - map-specific, gain one for each big coin
RedCoinsInMap, Token_RedCoinCounter - as above but for red coins

Initially progress is completely linear, with one level == one soul, and the next
level needing N+1 souls to access. As you find secret levels and big coins, though,
you can get ahead of the soul curve; secret levels contain one soul and no big coins.

There are three secret levels that must be found via exits in other maps, and three
more that require 12, 24, or 36 big coins to reach.

At 8 souls, you unlock 4 more levels all at once.

To reach the final boss, you need 15 souls; since there are only 12 "normal" levels,
you also need to do at least three of the (secret hidden + secret bigcoin) levels.
