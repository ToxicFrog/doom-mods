# The various SpaceCat actors are secrets, and spawn something else when found
# and petted.
# N.b. the weapon spawns (SC3 and SC4) may turn into ammo instead on some levels,
# not sure why. And of course even if they do turn into weapons, they are replaced
# by the SCS weapons, not the BFG/Plasma.
#
# This can currently be expressed in a mechanically correct manner with the category
# and typename directives, so that e.g. SpaceCatKirie, when scanned, is categorized
# as big-armor and placed into the item pool as BlueArmor.
# They can also just be left alone as a small, non-randomized bonus for the player.
# Ideally, I would like them to be entered into the item pool as themselves, so
# that you find a "SpaceCatTiger" in a chest somewhere, and then the receiving
# player can spawn it in and pet it for a powerup. And this works fine for most
# of them, but the weapon ones, specifically, may count as a weapon.
#
# Except that, since sometimes they *don't* spawn a weapon, we can't rely on this...
#
# We need changes to the GZAP and maybe even to the logic format to support that
# general idea ("treat this item as itself but for the purposes of logic treat it
# as something else"), which might also help with things like the Ashes keys that
# turn into vanilla keys/skulls when picked up, but for now we just pretend that
# they are ammo.
